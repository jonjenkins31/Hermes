"""Opt-in background thinking extension.

When --think is set, after each main turn the user's question is also dispatched
to a "thinking" LLM call running in a background thread. The thinking call uses
a chain-of-thought style system prompt and writes its result to thinking.jsonl
at the project root.

Why a background thread vs. inline:
- The main path returns immediately, so user-perceived latency is unchanged.
- The thinking call still uses the same llama.cpp model instance — we serialize
  with a lock so we never invoke the model concurrently (llama-cpp-python is
  not thread-safe for that).
- If the user submits the next prompt before thinking finishes, that prompt
  has to wait for the current thinking call to complete.

This is opt-in. Default agent paths pay zero cost.
