"""Tiny UI earcons for wake and follow-up cues.

Played by the voice loop to give the user audible feedback that the agent
heard them. Two cues:

  • wake     — single tone, plays right after wake-word match (or any
               phrase commit when wake-word gating is off). Tells the user
               "I heard you, processing your request."
  • followup — two-note tone (low → high), plays when the follow-up window
               opens. Tells the user "you can keep talking without
               re-saying the wake word."

Ported from VoiceLLM/audio/chimes.py with VoiceLLM-specific config refs
replaced by constructor arguments + sane defaults. The voice_loop is the
only caller; it pauses the mic around playback (or relies on AEC) so we
don't capture our own chime as user speech.
